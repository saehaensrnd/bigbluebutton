**Generate Joining Link for live join or RTMP**

Open `index.js` & change the value of `BBBUrl`, `BBBSalt` & `joinName` (if you want). Now run:

```javascript
npm install
node index.js "meetingId"
```

You should get joining link.

**Note:** Make sure that meeting is running otherwise will get error message.
